# World_Weather_Analysis

### Purpose 
In this analysis we used Open Weather APIs to obtain weather informations of cities all around the world by using their latitudes and longitudes 

With our DataFrame of cities we used Google APIS to create weather maps to discover correlations between latitude and parameters such as heat, wind and cloudiness. 

Using criterias like temperature  we filtered our results to show hotels based on those temperatures . 

In our challenge analysis specifcally we added descriptions to our filtered data and:
- Retrieved Weather Data
- Created customer travel destinations map
- Created a Travel Itineray map.
